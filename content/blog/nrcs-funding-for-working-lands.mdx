Healthy working landsâ€”whether timber, pasture, or row-cropâ€”donâ€™t stay productive by accident. They need disturbance, structure, and management. But many of the practices that improve wildlife habitat also improve farm profitability, forest value, water quality, and long-term resilience.

The challenge for most landowners isnâ€™t *what* needs to be done. Itâ€™s how to **afford doing it consistently**.

Thatâ€™s where NRCS funding comes in.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers a suite of cost-share and technical programs that help landowners improve their working lands at a fraction of the cost. And because these programs are designed around ecological functionâ€”soil health, hydrology, native vegetation, and wildlife habitatâ€”they align perfectly with the outcomes most landowners want: healthier forests, better hunting, stronger forage, cleaner water, and long-term land value.

This guide explains how NRCS programs work, what practices they fund, how they benefit wildlife, and how **Wild Lands can serve as your representative** throughout the entire process.

## **Why NRCS Funding Exists**

NRCS programs exist to incentivize landowners to implement practices that improve:

- Soil health  
- Water quality  
- Hydrologic function  
- Wildlife habitat  
- Forest productivity  
- Climate resilience  
- Long-term working-land viability  

Whether you own **20 acres** of mixed pine-hardwood or **2,000 acres** of bottomland, NRCS programs help offset the cost of desirable management practicesâ€”sometimes up to **75â€“90%**.

For many landowners, these programs mean the difference between â€œI hope to improve the land somedayâ€ and â€œWe are doing the work *this year*.â€

## **The Big Three NRCS Programs Most Landowners Use**

### **1. EQIP (Environmental Quality Incentives Program)**

This is the most commonly used program for private landowners. EQIP provides cost-share for:

- Prescribed burning  
- Forest stand improvement (FSI)  
- Invasive species removal  
- Early successional habitat creation  
- Cover crops and reduced-till systems  
- Water control structures  
- Wetland enhancement  
- Riparian buffer establishment  
- Native grass and forb plantings  
- Watering systems for grazing  

EQIP is highly compatible with wildlife goals, timber goals, grazing goals, or a combination of the three. Many of the practices also align with state wildlife agency recommendations.

### **2. CSP (Conservation Stewardship Program)**

CSP is for landowners already doing stewardship work and wanting to **level up** into more advanced conservation. It pays *annual* stewardship payments in addition to cost-share enhancements.

Examples include:

- Maintaining rotational disturbance regimes  
- Creating wildlife corridors  
- Enhancing pollinator habitat  
- Managing forest openings  
- Monitoring vegetative structure  
- Improving soil carbon retention  

CSP rewards landowners for doing conservation wellâ€”and continuing to do it.

### **3. ACEP (Agricultural Conservation Easement Program)**

This is for landowners wanting to protect:

- Wetlands  
- Floodplain buffers  
- Habitat connectivity  
- Groundwater recharge areas  
- Working agricultural land  

ACEP is more permanent, but can dramatically improve wildlife habitat while compensating landowners for restricting development.

## **How NRCS Practices Directly Benefit Wildlife**

The overlap between â€œgood for the landownerâ€ and â€œgood for wildlifeâ€ is substantial.

### **Better Forest Structure**
EQIP-funded *forest stand improvement* removes low-quality trees, increases sunlight, and encourages native understory. This means:

- More browse for deer  
- More insects and nesting cover for turkey  
- More structure for quail  
- Better pollinator forage  
- Higher timber value  

### **Restored Hydrology**
NRCS supports wetland restoration, streambank repair, and hydrologic reconnection, improving:

- Waterfowl habitat  
- Amphibian breeding areas  
- Clean water for fish and downstream users  
- Floodplain function  

### **Early Successional Habitat**
Practices like prescribed fire, disking, and native plantings create conditions needed by quail, rabbits, songbirds, and pollinators.

### **Native Plant Communities**
Native grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs mean:

- Stronger seasonal forage  
- Better fawning and nesting cover  
- Higher-quality edge habitat  
- Improved soil and water retention  

### **Connected Habitat**
CSP enhancements encourage corridor creation and maintenanceâ€”benefiting everything from black bear to migrating songbirds.

In short: **NRCS funding helps create the habitat the land wants to beâ€”and the habitat wildlife needs.**

## **Why This Matters to Working Landowners**

Improving habitat doesnâ€™t have to hurt timber yield or farm productivity. In most cases, the two reinforce each other:

- Better soil = better crops  
- Better sunlight = healthier understory = better timber growth  
- Healthier hydrology = fewer washouts & higher resilience  
- Structured edge cover = better hunting & recreation income  
- Native vegetation = reduced fertilizer & input costs  

NRCS helps landowners steward the land the way it *wants* to functionâ€”while adding real economic value.

## **Where Landowners Often Get Stuck**

Even experienced landowners run into challenges like:

- Choosing the right program  
- Matching practices to landowner goals  
- Understanding contract obligations  
- Meeting documentation requirements  
- Writing management plans  
- Coordinating contractors  
- Ensuring practices meet NRCS specs  
- Scheduling prescribed fire  
- Monitoring and photo-point requirements  
- Staying compliant over multiple years  

This is where **having a representative matters**.

Wild Lands acts as the landownerâ€™s project manager, translator, and field stewardâ€”bridging what NRCS requires with what the landowner wants.
